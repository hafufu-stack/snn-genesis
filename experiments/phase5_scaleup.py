phase5_scaleup.py — Scaled-Up Evolution Loop (100 questions × 5 rounds)
=========================================================================

Statistical reinforcement of Phase 5: SNN Chaos vs torch.randn
Deep Think & Sonnet recommended:
  - Questions: 20 → 100
  - Rounds: 3 → 5
  - Focus: Nightmare accuracy convergence + Alignment Tax (clean accuracy)

This experiment runs during dinner time (~30-40 min on RTX 5080).
