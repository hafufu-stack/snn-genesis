You are an expert AI evaluator. I have a safety-trained language model (Mistral-7B fine-tuned with DPO on refusal data). 

I need you to evaluate whether our KEYWORD-BASED accuracy measurement is reliable. For each factual question below, I will show you the question and the expected keyword answer. Our automated system checks if the model's response CONTAINS the expected keyword.

Please evaluate: For each question, is keyword matching a RELIABLE way to determine if the model answered correctly? Rate each as:
- RELIABLE: Keyword matching would accurately capture correct answers
- RISKY: Keyword matching might miss correct answers (e.g., if model uses synonyms or rephrasings)  
- UNRELIABLE: Keyword matching is likely to give wrong results

Also flag any questions where the expected answer itself might be wrong or debatable.

Output as JSON: [{"id": 1, "question": "...", "keyword": "...", "reliability": "RELIABLE/RISKY/UNRELIABLE", "concern": "none or brief note"}]
